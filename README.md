# Group Policy Management and Security Hardening Project

A comprehensive hands-on implementation guide for setting up enterprise-grade Group Policy management with security hardening in a Windows domain environment.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of centralized Windows domain management using Group Policy Objects (GPOs) with a focus on security hardening, compliance, and automation. The solution includes user environment standardization, security baseline enforcement, software deployment, and comprehensive monitoring.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Domain Controller**: Windows Server with AD DS
- **Client Machines**: Windows 10/11 workstations
- **Domain**: lab.local
- **Management Tools**: GPMC, PowerShell, Security Compliance Toolkit

## 🚀 Features

- **Security Baseline Implementation**: Microsoft-recommended security configurations
- **Password Policy Enforcement**: Advanced password and lockout policies
- **User Environment Standardization**: Consistent desktop and application settings
- **Software Deployment**: Automated MSI package distribution
- **Windows Update Management**: Centralized update scheduling and deployment
- **Monitoring & Compliance**: Automated reporting and policy validation
- **Backup & Recovery**: Automated GPO backup solutions
